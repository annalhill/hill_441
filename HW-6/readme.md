# HW-6 Readme for Anna Hill

(Link to Live Site)[https://annalhill.github.io/hill_441/HW-6/index.html]

I didn't find this assignment quite as hard as previous lessons however it did take me a bit to read through the elements and figure out how to put it all together. In the end, my biggest trouble was making my work show up on the webpage. For a while it has only showed up as the index.html text. I am wondering if I am calling in the javascript document incorrectly? I plan to talk to Dr. Musick about this later today and hopefully resolve the issue.

1. Developed background and canvas
2. Created document elements and where they would be found (aka, header, paragraph, etc), similar to how you would preform the action in HTML and CSS
3. Defined the text
4. Defined the style and placement of the text
5. Linked my image
6. Told the script what order to place my elements
