#### Notes:
1. Numbers: Just as you'd expect, you can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
  - Binary numbers
  - Numbers can be written as stand alone, they can also be used in the context of console.log(); which allows them to be used in the context of words as well

2. Strings: Represent context
  - "", ''
  - Strings can only be added together, i.e. "cat" + "woman"

3. Unary Operations
  - typeof: names what type of value you are using

```
console.log( typeof 1);
```

4. Boolean:
  - Two values that can be returned (true versus false)
  - NaN- Not a Number (Will never be equal to itself)

```
> // Greater than
< // Less than
>= // Greater than or equal to
<= // Less than or equal to
== // Equal to
!= // Not equal
&& // Logical and, Only true if both values are true or equal
|| // Logical or, true is either values given are true
```

  - Ternary: operates on three values including ! and :
    - Conditional operator
    - true spits out the middle values
    - false picks the right values 

```
console.log(true ? 1 : 2);
// returns 1
```
