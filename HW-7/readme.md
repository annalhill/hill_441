Choose your own adventure? Where to even begin...
Although I am more comfortable in HTML and CSS, I believe with the functions I managed to put together in the last assignment that there is no reason as to why I can't use javascript on everything in this one as well.

1. Build the base of a website with elements again.
2. Insert infographic Image to main page
3. Somehow... build links to each number on the map
