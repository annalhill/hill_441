Found on HTML5.net, I picked an online web template that utilizes html5, css, and javascript to create a sleek and modern portfolio site.

1. Change names
2. Change images to my own and alter the color palette to my branding colors: #185c55, #fed8a6, #fffff, #231f20
3. Delete functions that are not needed in my Design
4. Incorporate a scrolling button for the parallax
5. Go over every piece of code to decide if anything is too much or too little and make sure that it all works

	Languages used:
		jQuery (jquery.com)
