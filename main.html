          <p1> My name is Anna Hill, I am a 5th year senior in the Media Arts Department at the University of Montana. When I first started out in college, I jumped between aout six various majors trying to find my passion but what I eventially realized is that
             no matter what I chose, I was still drawn back to art and how expressing myself creativily was what kept my going. Although fine arts is a perfectly accpetable path to choose, I wanted to have the ability to explore all ends of the creative spectrum.
             This lead me to digital arts. Although my original passion was workign with logos and branding through graphic design programs, after my first few classes with Dr. Musick at the University I found that coding was on a whole new specrtrum of learning that
             challenged and excited me. Takign this 441 class is simply the next step to help me learn and develope my skills as a web designer and I can't wait for the challenges that await me!
